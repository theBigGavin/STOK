# Tasks: 股票 AI 策略回测决策系统

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-stock-ai-decision-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per Constitution Testing Standards. All features must include appropriate tests with coverage targets: backend ≥80%, frontend ≥70%.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for stock recommendations endpoint in backend/tests/contract/test_recommendations.py"
Task: "Integration test for recommendation user journey in backend/tests/integration/test_recommendations.py"
Task: "Unit tests for recommendation logic in backend/tests/unit/test_recommendation_service.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Stock model in backend/src/models/stock_models.py"
Task: "Create AIModel model in backend/src/models/database.py"
Task: "Create Decision model in backend/src/models/database.py"
Task: "Create VoteResult model in backend/src/models/database.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 95 tasks across all phases
**Task Distribution**:

- Setup: 7 tasks
- Foundational: 12 tasks
- User Story 1: 19 tasks
- User Story 2: 15 tasks
- User Story 3: 15 tasks
- User Story 4: 15 tasks
- Polish: 12 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 68 tasks marked with [P] can run in parallel
**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (获取 AI 选股推荐)
